A machine learning project predicting student registry status for the upcoming university semester.

Project authors: **Lina Hourieh**, **Sara Ghaboura**, **Zeinab Zeitoun** and **Imad Moustafa**

## why is it important to predict student status?
- Optimizing resources such as books, labs, materials, dormatory, lecturer contract and etc. 
- Being prepared to help out students acadamically, financially and psychologically.
- Helping out in budget planning 

## How to predict student status?
Traditional ways are time consuming and inaccurate so we tried machine learning method.

## Libraries used:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- shap

## Scaling techniques adapted:
- Robust Scaling
- Standard Scaling

## Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas

+ Students dropping tend to have more number of warnings

+ 20% of students who didnâ€™t pay any of their fees dropped out of university where as only 3% of the students who fully paid the fees dropped
